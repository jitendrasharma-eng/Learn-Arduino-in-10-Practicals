# Learn-Arduino-in-10-Practicals
This repository contains **10 hands-on experiments** to help beginners learn **Arduino programming and hardware interfacing** step by step. Each experiment includes **circuit diagrams, code, and explanations**. 

Experiment 1: Blinking LED
Components:
Arduino Uno
LED (any color)
220Ω resistor
The blinking LED experiment is the "Hello World" of embedded systems. It demonstrates how to control an LED using an Arduino.

The setup() function configures pin 13 as an output.
The loop() function turns the LED ON for 1 second and then OFF for 1 second, repeating indefinitely.
How to Run This Experiment
1️⃣ Connect the LED to pin 13 of Arduino (with a 220Ω resistor in series).
2️⃣ Upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
3️⃣ Observe the LED blinking every 1 second.
